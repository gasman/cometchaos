Retabulate
==========

The Retabulate plugin ensures that your Rails source files are indented with
tabs rather than spaces. (Hopefully, the fact that you're interested in this
plugin means that you think this is a good idea. If not - move along please,
nothing to see here...)

It does this via two methods: by providing a rake task to sweep the codebase
of your application and convert any space-indented files it finds, and by
intercepting the output of generators, converting any new files as they are
created.

By default, reindenting is performed on files with the extensions .rb,
.html.erb, .css and .js. Note that YAML source files are required to use spaces
for indenting, so these are left alone.


Usage
=====

With the plugin installed, generators will produce tab-indented output with no
further setup required. To perform a sweep of the codebase:

  rake retab

To change the set of file types which get converted, edit the
CONVERTABLE_FILETYPES regexp at the top of
vendor/plugins/retabulate/lib/retabulate.rb.


Bugs
====

This will probably get in the way horribly if you use plugins with
svn:externals.
